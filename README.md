# Performance Optimization Techniques

When working with large datasets, it is crucial to implement performance optimization techniques to ensure efficient data processing and querying. In this task, several strategies were employed to enhance performance

## Techniques Used

### 1. Streaming for Data Ingestion

To efficiently handle large JSON files, I utilized Node.js streams. This approach allows for reading the file in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. By streaming the data, memory usage is minimized, and the application's responsiveness is improved, particularly during data ingestion. This method is beneficial for processing large datasets, enabling the following:

- Reduction of memory overhead.
- Immediate processing of data as soon as a chunk is available, rather than waiting for the entire file to be read.

### 2. Database Indexing

To optimize query performance in the database, several indices were created on frequently queried fields. The following indices were added to the `RecordSchema`:

```javascript
RecordSchema.index({ username: 1 });
RecordSchema.index({ created_at: 1 });
RecordSchema.index({ status: 1 });
RecordSchema.index({ leaked_sources: 1 });
RecordSchema.index({ username: 1, status: 1 });
RecordSchema.index({ created_at: 1, status: 1, username: 1 });
RecordSchema.index({ username: 'text', url: 'text', status: 'text' });
```

These indices enhance the speed of read operations by allowing the database engine to quickly locate records without scanning the entire dataset.

### 3. Streaming Responses

When returning responses to the client, I utilized streaming to send data efficiently. By binding the Express response stream object, data can be sent in chunks, optimizing data transfer and improving response times. This approach aids in the following:

- Reduction of latency by sending data as it becomes available.
- Minimization of the memory footprint on the server by avoiding the retention of the entire response in memory.

By implementing these techniques, the application is able to efficiently handle large datasets, resulting in improved performance and a better user experience.
